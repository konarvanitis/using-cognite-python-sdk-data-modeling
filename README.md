# Using Cognite Python SDK 

This repo is used for the Cognite Academy course: https://learn.cognite.com/learn-to-use-the-cognite-python-sdk

This gives you an introduction to the Cognite Python SDK, with examples you can run yourself. Connecting to a Cognite Academy CDF project with "world-population-data", but also gives you the experience of how to write data into CDF. If there are any questions, please reach out on Cognite Hub: https://hub.cognite.com/groups/academy-discussions-175

A step-by-step guide with practical examples and code for using the Cognite Python SDK.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/konarvanitis/using-cognite-python-sdk-data-modeling
```

### 2. Install dependencies

We recommend using uv to manage your Python virtual environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

This installs the dependencies defined in `pyproject.toml` and creates a virtual environment in the project folder.

### 3. Run the notebooks

Open the repo in your IDE (e.g., VS Code) and start exploring the Jupyter notebooks.

> **Note:** You may need to select the uv virtual environment (`.venv`) as your kernel.

## Alternative: pip installation

If you prefer not to use uv, you can install the SDK directly with pip:

```bash
pip install "cognite-sdk[pandas]"
```

## Troubleshooting

### WSL: interactive login fails with `gio: ... Operation not supported`

On WSL, Python's interactive OAuth login (`1_Authentication.ipynb`) tries to open your default browser and can fail with an error like:

```
gio: https://login.microsoftonline.com/...: Operation not supported
```

This happens because WSL has no browser handler registered for the login URL. Copy the URL from the error message and paste it directly into your Windows browser — the login redirect to `localhost` will reach the notebook correctly thanks to WSL2's automatic localhost port forwarding.
